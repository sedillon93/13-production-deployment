=======
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codefellows/code-of-conduct)

Ready to share what you've made with the world? Yes!

Then you need to push your code to a web server accessible to the whole Internet. This is your "production environment".

We'll be using Heroku as our production server. Heroku is a "Platform as a Service": your code is plugged in to pre-configured servers, which are started up for the world to access.

---

## Heroku Deployment

1. Fork and clone the lab repository
2. Copy the starter code into a new directory **OUTSIDE OF THE EXISTING LAB ASSIGNMENT DIRECTORY**
3. Initialize a new repository in your new directory
4. Create a new Heroku app within your repository
3. Don't forget to set your Github Token as an environment variable in the Heroku app
4. Deploy to your new instance!
5. Let your brilliance shine unto the world!

## Submission Instructions
When you are finished with lab, follow these steps to submit your work.

1. Ensure that all your local changes are committed to `master`, and pushed to your origin repo.
2. Ensure that your `master` branch is deployed to Heroku
3. Submit the link to your deployed site as well as the link to your merged `master` branch on Github.


## Learning Objectives

- Be able to push a dev site to production, so the world can see it.
- Understand the difference between a static page and a dynamically generated app page.

## Resources  

- [Heroku: Getting Started with Node](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction)
- [Deploying a Simple Blog to Heroku](https://howtonode.org/deploy-blog-to-heroku)

## Feature Tasks  

1. As a site owner, I want my site running on a robust hosting platform, so that I don't have to hire a sysadmin.
 - Create a new Heroku app for deployment.
1. As a developer, I want my app to run in a development environment that matches production, so that I can reduce bugs related to infrastructure surprises.
 - Start your app with `node server.js`
 - TODO: Refactor your AJAX request to proxy your GitHub API calls through the server
1. As a developer, I want my secret tokens accessed only through environment variables, so that I can keep them secure.
 - Set the proper env vars on your local system.
 - Ensure your code passes ESLint
 - DO NOT create your Heroku app with a default name. If you do accidentally, rename it. Or blow it away, and start again.
 - Link to your live site in your README, for whichever repo you deploy.

#### Stretch Goals  

 1. As a site owner, I want [blog.my-own-domain-name.io] hooked up to my Heroku app, so that I don't have to explain to people how to spell "myblog.herokuapp.com" over the phone.
